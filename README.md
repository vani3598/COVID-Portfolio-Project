In my COVID-19 Data Exploration Project, I harnessed the potential of SQL Server and Tableau to analyze and visualize critical pandemic data. Focusing on country-specific death rates and vaccination rates, this project offers a comprehensive perspective on the COVID-19 impact. By combining data analytics with interactive visualization, I've provided an in-depth understanding of how different nations have been affected by the virus and how vaccination campaigns are progressing. Explore the dynamic dashboards to gain insights into the evolving landscape of the global pandemic, showcasing the power of data analysis and visualization in understanding a critical global issue.
